This is a full stack website which is a facebook clone that I developed using MERN Stack in May - June 2021 to learn more about as well as practice back-end technologies and principles. I wasn't very comfortable with back-end technologies at that time and a lot of it was developed by looking at various tutorials and the project was in a hiatus for a while as I began my first physical semester at college. I later fixed the problems in the back-end and got the database to run. There are still some minors,. I still from time to time like to work on this project and either fix the bugs or add new features so as to get more familiarized with and learn more about back-end web development.

Features: - the user can register accounts, post on a common home message wall, set up their profiles with details about themselves, private and public messaging (still working on it), like/dislike/reply to posts.
