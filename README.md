This is a full stack website I made ot learn mnore about back-end web development and full stack development. This project helped me learn the principles of back-end
technologies like Node/Express, MongoDB, web tokens, creation of API's, and also generally how the back-end of a website works. Around halfway through the 
development, I had moved to the US and in that I had to shift to a new Computer and during that process, this project was on a hiatus and I also lost a lot of the
tests on REST API which I did. I finished the back-end and the front-end but due to my lack of experience in back-end, was unable to connect it with the front-end 
properly. Nevertheless, I'm satisfied with how much this project taught me about web development.
